## ✨ About

**jsFlake** is a personalized and was originally planned for closed-source, but I have decided to make it open-source. So, what is jsFlake? jsFlake is a Discord Bot that was for being my personal assistant, since I use Discord a lot, I have decided to make a bot that can assist me with my daily life by arranging my schedule, and even handle my API that is also for everyone!
